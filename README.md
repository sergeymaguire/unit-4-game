# unit-4-game
This game was really fun for me to build it was the first time I was using JavaScripts library Jquery.  Using Jquery made the game much easier to write with less and cleaner code then if done with JavaScript.  The goal of this game is to match the computers randomly generated number by clicking on the crystal images(there are four of them) which also have a random value between 1-10.  Everytime the game is won, lost, or refreshed the computer number and crystal numbers are randomized again.  I also attached a set of instructions on the game itself.  The most challenging part of this for me was adding the crystal images values together.  Some things I wanted to add or could have done better would be the styling but for the most part I think this was a solid game that anyone can play and have fun with.
